<!-- Copilot Prompt: "Describe how to balance AI-assisted coding with peer review and oversight in software teams." -->

## Pair Copilot with Manual Code Reviews

AI-generated code should complement—not replace—human expertise. Peer reviews ensure quality and trustworthiness.

Best Practices:
- Use pull requests and code reviews before merging AI-generated code.
- Assign experienced reviewers to junior developers using Copilot.
- Maintain a Copilot policy for review and approval.

Suggested Workflow:
1. Developer uses Copilot to scaffold a function.
2. Submit code for peer review.
3. Run static checks and tests.
4. Revise and merge upon validation.
