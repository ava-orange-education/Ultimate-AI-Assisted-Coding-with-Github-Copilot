## Use Copilot for Learning and Skill Building

GitHub Copilot can help developers explore unfamiliar syntax, libraries, and design patterns.

Best Practices:
- Review generated suggestions to learn alternative implementations.
- Encourage junior developers to use Copilot for onboarding.
- Prompt Copilot with unfamiliar keywords or docstrings to discover new patterns.
- Track prompt styles that yield better suggestions.

Example:

Prompt:

# Fetch data from API asynchronously

async def fetch_data(url: str):
    """Fetches JSON data from an API using async/await."""
