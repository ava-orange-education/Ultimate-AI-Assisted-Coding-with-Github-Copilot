# Dos and Don'ts When Using GitHub Copilot for Learning

## Dos:
- Use Copilot as a **learning companion**, not just an autocomplete tool.
- Ask for **explanations** and tweak the generated code to deepen understanding.
- Compare Copilot’s output with your own logic and refine it.
- Validate AI-generated code by running and debugging it manually.
- Use it to explore **alternative approaches** and real-world design patterns.

## Don’ts:
- Don’t blindly copy-paste AI code without understanding it.
- Don’t assume the generated solution is always correct or optimal.
- Don’t skip **manual debugging** just because the code runs.
- Don’t rely solely on Copilot for completing assignments—focus on learning.
- Don’t ignore foundational concepts; AI should **reinforce**, not replace them.

> These guidelines help ensure Copilot strengthens your programming journey, rather than becoming a crutch.
