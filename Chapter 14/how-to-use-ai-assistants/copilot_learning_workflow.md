# Strategic Workflow for Using GitHub Copilot in Learning

## 1. Understand the Problem First
Before using Copilot, break down the problem into logical steps on your own.

## 2. Attempt to Code Independently
Try writing your own version of the code—even if it’s incomplete or has errors. This strengthens problem-solving muscles.

## 3. Use Copilot for Explanations
If stuck, ask Copilot to:
- Explain a concept (e.g., recursion, list comprehension)
- Suggest a possible approach (not the full solution)

## 4. Compare and Contrast
After Copilot generates code:
- Compare it with your own version.
- Analyze its structure and logic.
- Identify which part you would have written differently.

## 5. Debug and Test the Code
- Run test cases.
- Introduce edge cases.
- Add comments and improve readability.

## 6. Reflect and Relearn
After solving the problem:
- Write a short explanation of what you learned.
- Try solving the problem again without Copilot.

> This workflow transforms GitHub Copilot from a shortcut to a true **learning accelerator**.
