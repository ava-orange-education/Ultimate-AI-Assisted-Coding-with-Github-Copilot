# Copilot Prompt: "Explain the logic to check if a number is prime."

A prime number is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.

To check if a number is prime:
- Loop from 2 to the square root of the number.
- If any number in that range divides the input evenly, it is not a prime.
- If no such divisor is found, it's a prime number.
