# AI-Generated Applications

<!-- Copilot Prompt: "Describe a scenario where AI can create an entire application with minimal human input." -->

AI is increasingly capable of generating end-to-end applications. Developers provide functional specifications and Copilot generates full modules.

Example:

- Input: "I want a todo list app with user auth and task management"
- Output: AI scaffolds backend, authentication system, React UI, and tests

This scenario is emerging in internal tools, CRUD apps, and admin dashboards.
