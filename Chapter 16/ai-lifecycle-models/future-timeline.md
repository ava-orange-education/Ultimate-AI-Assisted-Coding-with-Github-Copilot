# Future Timeline of AI in Software Development

<!-- Copilot Prompt: "Predict the evolution of AI-assisted development over the next decade." -->

This timeline forecasts the evolution of AI’s role in software development between 2025 and 2035.

## Timeline

**2025–2026**  
AI tools assist in 50% or more of enterprise code writing. Human-led design and reviews still dominate.

**2027–2028**  
AI takes over most repetitive test writing and auto-generates CI/CD scripts.

**2029–2030**  
End-to-end CRUD, REST APIs, and backend infrastructure are handled by AI templates.

**2031–2033**  
Hybrid teams become the norm, where developers orchestrate AI agents. Prompt engineering becomes a formal skill.

**2034–2035**  
Fully autonomous AI agents begin building production-quality modules. Developers focus on design thinking, ethics, and oversight.

The future suggests a strong shift toward AI-human collaboration with increasing autonomy for generative tools like GitHub Copilot.
