# AI-Assisted Development Workflow

<!-- Copilot Prompt: "Visualize an end-to-end AI-assisted software development workflow." -->

This document outlines a typical AI-assisted software development workflow. GitHub Copilot plays a supportive role across planning, coding, testing, and deployment stages.

## Development Stages

1. Requirement Gathering  
2. Prompt Design  
3. Code Generation with Copilot  
4. Unit Testing (Copilot + Manual)  
5. Code Review  
6. CI/CD Automation  
7. Release and Monitoring
